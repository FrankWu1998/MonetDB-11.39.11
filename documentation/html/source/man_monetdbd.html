<h3>DESCRIPTION<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> is the MonetDB Database Server daemon. The program is mainly
meant to be used as daemon, but it also allows to setup and change the
configuration of a dbfarm. The use of <em>monetdbd</em> is either as
user-oriented way to configure, start and stop a database farm, or to be
started from a startup script, such as from <em>/etc/init.d/</em> on Linux
systems or <em>smf</em>(5) on Solaris systems, as part of a system startup.</p>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> is the system formerly known as <em>merovingian</em>. It was renamed
to <em>monetdbd</em> since the name <em>merovingian</em> proved to be confusing to
most regular end-users. Internally, <em>monetdbd</em> uses the name
<em>merovingian</em> at many places for historical reasons.</p>
<p>A <em>monetdbd</em> instance manages one local cluster based, which is a
directory in the system, referred to as the <em>dbfarm</em>. Nowadays, the
dbfarm location always has to be given as argument to <em>monetdbd</em>.</p>
<p>Within its local cluster <em>monetdbd</em> takes care of starting up databases
when necessary, and stopping them either upon request via <em>monetdb</em>(1)
or when being shut down. Client database connections are made against
<em>monetdbd</em> initially which redirects or proxies the client to the
appropriate database process, started on the fly when necessary.</p>
<p>When started, <em>monetdbd</em> runs by default in the background, sending log
messages to <em>merovingian.log</em>, until being sent a stop, terminate or
interrupt signal, possibly using the stop command of <em>monetdbd</em>.</p>
<p><em>monetdbd</em> uses a neighbor discovery scheme to detect other <em>monetdbd</em>
processes running in the local network. Databases from those remote
instances are made available to a locally connecting client. Remote
databases never override local databases, and their availability is
controlled by the remote <em>monetdbd</em> process. See also the sharing
capabilities of <em>monetdb</em>(1) and the <em>REMOTE DATABASES</em> section below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="commands">
<h3>COMMANDS<a class="headerlink" href="#commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The commands for <em>monetdbd</em> are <strong>create</strong>, <strong>start</strong>, <strong>stop</strong>,
<strong>get</strong>, <strong>set</strong>, <strong>version</strong>, and <strong>help</strong>. The commands facilitate
initializing a dbfarm, starting and stopping the MonetDB Database
Server, and retrieving or setting options.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>create dbfarm</strong></dt><dd><p>Initializes a new database farm, such that a MonetDB Database Server
can be started on that location. All necessary directories are
attempted to be created, and an initial properties file is created in
the directory itself. <em>dbfarm</em> must be a location addressable in the
local filesystem hierarchy.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>start</strong> [<strong>-n</strong>] <em>dbfarm</em></dt><dd><p>Starts <em>monetdbd</em>, the MonetDB Database Server, on the given dbfarm.
When the <strong>-n</strong> flag is given, <em>monetdbd</em> will not fork into the
background, but instead remain attached to the calling environment,
until given a stop signal.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>stop</strong> <em>dbfarm</em></dt><dd><p>Sends a stop signal to the <em>monetdbd</em> process responsible for the
given dbfarm.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>get</strong> &lt;<strong>all</strong> | <em>property</em>[,<em>property</em>[,..]]&gt; <em>dbfarm</em></dt><dd><p>Prints the requested properties, or all known properties, for the
given dbfarm. For each property, its value is printed. Some
properties are virtual, and given for information purposes only, they
cannot be modified using the <strong>set</strong> command.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>set</strong> <em>property</em><strong>=</strong><em>value</em> <em>dbfarm</em></dt><dd><p>Sets property to value for the given database. For a list of
properties, run <strong>monetdbd get all</strong>. Some properties require a
restart of the MonetDB Database Server in order to take effect. The
<strong>set</strong> command, will however always write the property, and tell the
running <em>monetdbd</em> to reload the properties file (if running). For an
explanation of the properties, see the <em>CONFIGURATION</em> section below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configuration">
<h3>CONFIGURATION<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> reads its properties from the <em>.merovingian_properties</em> file
inside the dbfarm. This file is created by the <strong>create</strong> command. This
file is not meant to be edited manually, instead it should be updated
using the <strong>set</strong> command. The following properties can be set:</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>logfile</strong></dt><dd><p>This property points to the file where all log messages are written
to. It is relative to the dbfarm directory, but can be absolute to
point to e.g. another medium. Changing this property takes effect
immediately at runtime.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>pidfile</strong></dt><dd><p><em>Monetdbd</em> stores the process ID of the background server in the file
pointed to by this property. The same rules apply as for the
<strong>logfile</strong> property.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>sockdir</strong></dt><dd><p>For faster access, <em>monetdbd</em> uses UNIX domain sockets for its
control mechanism and regular database connections. The sockets are
placed as files in the filesystem hierarchy. The <strong>sockdir</strong> property
controls in which directory they are placed. In general this setting
should not be changed.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>port</strong></dt><dd><p>This property specifies which TCP port <em>monetdbd</em> should listen to
for connection requests. Defaults to 50000.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>ipv6</strong></dt><dd><p>This property forces <em>monetdbd</em> to bind connections on IPv6 addresses
only. Defaults to false.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>listenaddr</strong></dt><dd><p>This property specifies an address that is allowed to connect to the
server. The user can specify one IP(v6) address, or use the 0.0.0.0
notation to allow connections from everywhere. Defaults to localhost
(127.0.0.1).</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>control</strong></dt><dd><p>For remote management of <em>monetdbd</em>, the <strong>control</strong> property
specifies whether or not to enable remote management. Note that for
remote management, a passphrase is required, see below. It defaults
to false for security reasons. Changing this property takes effect
immediately at runtime.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>passphrase</strong></dt><dd><p>To control <em>monetdbd</em> from a remote machine, a passphrase is
necessary, to be given to <em>monetdb</em>(1). The passphrase can be
either given as hashed value prefixed by the hash type in curly
braces (e.g. {SHA512}xxx...) or as plain text value which will be
hashed automatically. Note that the only hash accepted is the one
specified at configure time, which is &#64;PASSWORD_BACKEND&#64;. Changing
this property takes effect immediately at runtime.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>snapshotdir</strong></dt><dd><p>This property specifies where the <em>monetdb snapshot create</em> command
stores its snapshots. There is no default value. If unset, no
snapshots can be created.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>snapshotcompression</strong></dt><dd><p>This property specifies whether database snapshots created by
<em>monetdb snapshot create</em> are compressed, and if so, using which
algorithm. The default value is <em>.tar.lz4</em> if LZ4 compression is
available, or <em>.tar</em> otherwise. Other supported values are, if
available, <em>.tar.gz</em>, <em>.tar.xz</em>, and <em>.tar.bz2</em>. These more efficient
but much slower compression algorithms are usually not recommended
for backups of large databases because it would take enormous amounts
of time.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>discovery</strong></dt><dd><p>Specifies whether neighbor discovery is to be enabled using UDP
broadcasts or not. The broadcasts are done on the same portnumber as
the port setting.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>discoveryttl</strong></dt><dd><p><em>Monetdbd</em> publishes locally available databases to others
periodically. The interval used here, defined in seconds, depends on
the time-to-live of the databases before they need to get refreshed.
The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes), which should keep traffic in
your network fairly low. Additions and removals are processed
immediately regardless of this timeout. If you are in a network
environment where physical network links disappear often, you may
want to decrease this value to more quickly remove no longer
reachable databases.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>exittimeout</strong></dt><dd><p>if <em>monetdbd</em> stops a running mserver, for example in response to a
<em>monetdb stop</em> command or when <em>monetdbd</em> itself is shutting down, it
first sends the mserver a SIGTERM signal to trigger a graceful
shutdown. If that takes more than <strong>exittimeout</strong> seconds, SIGKILL is
sent as a last resort. This may cause (partial) data loss. A time-out
value of 0 means no mservers will be shut down, and hence they will
continue to run after <em>monetdbd</em> has shut down. Note that this
particular configuration is extremely inconvenient. The default
time-out is 60 seconds. If your databases are rather large and you
find your databases consistently being killed by <em>monetdbd</em> upon
shutdown, you may want to increase this time-out. Changing this
property takes effect immediately at runtime.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>forward</strong></dt><dd><p><em>monetdbd</em> has two ways in which it can &quot;attach&quot; a connecting client
to the target database. The first method, <strong>redirect</strong>, uses a
redirect sent to the client with the responsible mserver process. The
second method, <strong>proxy,</strong> proxies the client to the mserver over
<em>monetdbd</em>. While <strong>redirect</strong> is more efficient, it requires the
connecting client to be able to connect to the mserver. In many
settings this may be undesirable or even impossible, since a wide
range of open ports and routing are necessary for this. In such case
the <strong>proxy</strong> technique of <em>monetdbd</em> is a good solution, which also
allows a <em>monetdbd</em> instance on the border of a network to serve
requests to nodes in the local (unreachable) network. Note that for
local databases, the <strong>proxy</strong> method uses a UNIX domain socket
feature to pass file-descriptors to the local mserver. This
effectively is as efficient as the <em>redirect</em> approach, but still
hides away the mservers properly behind <em>monetdbd</em>. Hence, in
practice it is only relevant for connections to remote databases to
use redirects instead of proxies. Changing this property takes effect
immediately at runtime.</p>

<div class="section" id="remote-databases">
<h3>REMOTE DATABASES<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-databases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The neighbor discovery capabilities of <em>monetdbd</em> allow a user to
contact a remote database transparently, as if it were a local database.
By default, all local databases are announced in the network, such that
neighbors can pick them up to make them available for their local users.
This feature can be disabled globally, or on database level. For the
latter, the <em>monetdb</em>(1) utility can be used to change the share
property of a database.</p>
<p>While neighbor discovery in itself is sufficient to locate a database in
a cluster, it is limited in expressiveness. For instance, database names
are assumed to be unique throughout the entire system. This means local
databases overshadow remote ones, and duplicate remote entries cannot be
distinguished. To compensate for this, <em>monetdbd</em> allows to adds a
<strong>tag</strong> to each database that is being shared. This tag is sent in
addition to the database name, and only understood by other
<em>monetdbd</em>s.</p>
<p>Tags are arbitrary ASCII-strings matching the pattern [A-Za-z0-9./]+.
There are no assumed semantics in the tag, which allows for multiple
approaches when using the tag. The tag is always used in combination
with the database name. For this, the `/' character is used as
separator, which hence suggests the user to use that character as
separator for multilevel tags. <em>Monetdbd</em> allows common path globbing
using `*' on tags, which allows for many use-cases. Consider for
instance the following three databases with their tag:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>dbX/master/tableQ</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>dbY/slave/tableQ</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>dbZ/slave/tableQ</p>
<p>A default match has implicit `/<em>' added to the search, making
more generic search strings match more specific ones. Hence, a
connect with database *dbX</em> is the same as <em>dbX/*</em> and hence
matches <em>dbX/master/tableQ</em>. Similar, a database connect for
<em>*/master</em> matches the same database as before. Note that the
implicit `/<em>' is not added if that would cause no matches,
such as for **/master/tableQ</em> which would return all masters
for <em>tableQ</em>, which in our hypothetical example is only <em>dbX</em>.
In contrast, a database connect for <em>*/slave/tableQ</em> matches
with either <em>dbY</em> or <em>dbZ</em>. <em>Monetdbd</em> returns the two options
to the client in a round-robin fashion, such that subsequent
connects for the same pattern result in a load-balanced connect
to either of both databases.</p>
<p>With tags in use, one can possibly make distinction between
databases, if setup like that. The previous example could hence
also be setup like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>tableQ/master</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>tableQ/slave</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>tableQ/slave</p>
<p>Connecting to <em>tableQ/slave</em> would now return either
of both databases even though they are not unique
(apart from the host they are located on, which is not
shown in the example). While being confusing for
humans, for <em>monetdbd</em> it is the same situation as in
the previous example. However, because globbing allows
to make things easier to understand, tags for both
slaves could be changed to <em>slaveX</em> or <em>slave/X</em> and
use the necessary pattern to match them. It is up to
the user to decide how to use the tags.</p>

<h3>MULTIPLEX-FUNNELS<a class="headerlink" href="#multiplex-funnels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> implements multiplex-funnel capabilities. As the name
suggests two techniques are combined, the multiplexer and the funnel.</p>
<p>The <em>funnel</em> capability limits the access to the database to one client
at a time. That is, if multiple clients connect to the funnel, their
queries will be serialized such that they are executed one after the
other. An effect of this approach is that clients no longer have an
exclusive channel to the database, which means that individual queries
from one client may have been interleaved with queries from others. This
most notably makes SQL transaction blocks unreliable with a funnel. The
funnel, hence, is meant to scale down a large amount of clients that
perform short-running (read-only) queries, as typically seen in
web-based query loads.</p>
<p>When a funnel is defined to use multiple databases, the funnel adds a
<em>multiplexer</em> to its query channel. A multiplex-funnel sends each query
to all of the defined databases. This behavior can be quite confusing at
first, but proves to be useful in typical sharding configurations, where
in particular simple selection queries have to be performed on each of
the shards. The multiplexer combines the answers from all defined
databases in one single answer that it sends back to the client.
However, this combining is without any smart logic, that is, the
multiplexer does not evaluate the query it is running, but just combines
all answers it receives from the databases. This results in e.g. as many
return tuples for a <strong>SELECT COUNT(*)</strong> query, as there are databases
defined.</p>
<p>Due to the two above mentioned characteristics, a multiplex-funnel has
some limitations. As mentioned before, transactions over multiple
queries are likely not to result in the desired behavior. This is due to
each query to the funnel is required to be self-contained. Further,
since for each query, the results from multiple servers have to be
combined into one, that query must only return a single response, i.e.
multi-statement queries are most likely causing the funnel to respond
with an error, or return garbled results. Last, the size of each query
is limited to currently about 80K. While this size should be sufficient
for most queries, it is likely not enough for e.g. COPY INTO statements.
Apart from the data transfer implications, such statements should not be
used with the funnel, as the results will be undefined due to the
limited query buffer. Applications using the funnel should aim for short
and single-statement queries that require no transactions.</p>
<p>See the <strong>create</strong> command in the <em>monetdb</em>(1) man-page for details on
how to setup a multiplex-funnel.</p>

<div class="section" id="signals">
<h3>SIGNALS<a class="headerlink" href="#signals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> acts upon a number of signals as is common for a daemon.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT</strong></dt><dd><p>Any of these signals make <em>monetdbd</em> enter the shutdown sequence.
This sequence involves cleanly shutting down listener sockets,
shutting down all started databases and finally terminating itself.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>SIGHUP</strong></dt><dd><p>When this signal is received by <em>monetdbd</em> it will reopen the logfile
as pointed to by the <strong>logfile</strong> setting. Before it reopens the
logfile, it will re-read the properties file from the dbfarm, which
might result in opening a different file to continue logging.</p>

</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="return-value">
<h3>RETURN VALUE<a class="headerlink" href="#return-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>Monetdbd</em> returns exit code <strong>0</strong> if it was able to successfully
perform the requested action, e.g. start, stop, etc. When an error
occurs during the action, that prevents <em>monetdbd</em> from successfully
performing the action, the exit code <strong>1</strong> is returned.</p>
